Tired of "Was that 4 balls or 5?" No more dodgy math or heated debates. This is a simple web app to track scorecard of a cricket match ball by ball! Hopefully it will bring some peace to gully cricket community :) Cheers! 


### For future:

- Add options for match parameters, including the numofovers and teams. Making team selection optional will simplify the app and lower the threhold to use the it (note: teams can be unspecified).
  
- Implement functionality to differentiate between the team setting the target and the team chasing it. (note: maybe a toggle feature that allows users to specify whether a team is chasing or setting a score, and then user have to specify neccessary parameters (like target, team names, and overs), which would also address the first feature!)

- **Adv Features**:
  - *Scoreboard Sharing*: Allow users to share the scoreboard via a link/security code, which could be useful for gully cricket where umps change many times during a match!
  - *Advanced Mode*: Create a separate advanced mode to track player-wise data, while keeping the default mode simple for ease of use. This could also be a toggle feature, allowing users to enter advanced mode upon toggling.
